<h1>My bus tracker icon design</h1>

<p>I wanted the bus icon to be easily recognisable, but found out very early on that users found a bus that was 'pointing' left or right to be very confusing as they thought the bus was travelling in the direction it was pointing.  Therefore I chose a 'head-on' bus icon to avoid the direction of travel problem.</p>

<p>I had to make sure that the bus icon was transparent so it could work well with Google maps, and I also had to create a 'pin' shape so the exact location can be seen.</p>

<p>My bus icon is shown below.</p>

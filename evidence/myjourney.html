<h1>Finding issues and fixing them </h1>

<p>A few issues that I found and fixed are listed here.</p>
    
<p>I found that the javascript fetch() method does not support loading local files using the 'file://' protocol.  This meant that I couldn't test loading the JSON file without deploying the website to github.  This took me a few hours to figure out why it didn't work.</p>

<p>Setting up a Google Maps API key, which involves creating a billing account with Google, was pretty complex to understand.  I found it hard to understand what needed to be configured and it was quite a lot of trial and error involved.  You have to set up a new Google Project and enable the maps API, create a new set of API credentials in the project, and make sure your account is connected to a payment method.</p>

<p>As soon as I uploaded my source code to github, Google mailed me because I was using an unrestricted API key that would allow anyone to use the key for mapping.  The message looked like this (the API key has been covered up)</p>

<p>I fixed this by going into the Google API manager and setting a website restriction as below:</p>

<p>I first tried using a white background on my bus marker but it looked really ugly and blanked out the background</p>

<p>I fixed this by using paint.net to replace the white background with a transparent background</p>

<p>I was really surprised to find that Google Maps requires absolute paths to KML files rather than relative ones.  This caused me a lot of google searching and trial-and-error debugging to understand the reason my routes weren't loading.</p>
    
<p>After loading my KML route onto the Google Map I wanted to be able to change the appearance of the busstop marker the user has selected.  However, Google Maps doesn't let me alter a marker loaded as part of a KML layer, so I'm going to change to create thebus-stop markers.  This means I'll need to add the latitude and longitude of each bus-stop to the JSON data file.</p>

<p>Setting up a table in AWS DynamoDB was easy but setting up the security so it could be accessed from the webpage was really, really hard.  When I first did this I set the access key in the javascript but this got detected by AWS when I uploaded it to github as can be seen in the email below</p>

<p>I ended up having to set up an AWS Cognito 'identity pool' which works fine but it was not what I was expecting.</p>
<p>Overall, I've realised that cloud services like Google Maps and AWS DynamoDB, are really powerful but there is a huge amount of complexity that I didn't realise I was going to run into when using them.  My estimates of how long this would take were way off - I'll learn from that in future.</p>

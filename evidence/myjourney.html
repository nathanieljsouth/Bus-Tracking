<h1>Finding issues and fixing them </h1>

<p>A few issues that I found and fixed are listed here.</p>
    
<p>I found that the javascript fetch() method does not support loading local files using the 'file://' protocol.  This meant that I couldn't test loading the JSON file without deploying the website to github.  This took me a few hours to figure out why it didn't work.</p>

<p>Setting up a Google Maps APIK key, which involves creating a billing account with Google, was pretty complex to understand.  I found it hard to understand what needed to be configured and it was quite a lot of trial and error involved.</p>
